Clone this repo to your local machine

Before starting a new feature, run `git checkout master && git pull` to get the most up to date `master` branch.

On your local machine, create a local branch for the feature you're implementing. Branch names should follow the convention of your-initials/feature-to-be-implemented, such as `cm/updating-readme`. 

Make code changes to your local branch.

Push your changes to the remote branch by running `git push`
