Clone this repo to your local machine

Before starting a new feature, run `git checkout master && git pull` to get the most up to date `master` branch.

On your local machine, create a local branch for the feature you're implementing. Branch names should follow the convention of your-initials/feature-to-be-implemented, such as `cm/updating-readme`. 

Make code changes to your local branch. 

To commit your changes locally, run `git add .`, then `git commit -m 'message describing commit`.

Push your changes to the remote branch by running `git push --set-upstream origin cm/updating-readme`, replacing this branch name with your own.

You only need to set the upstream the first push. After that, running `git push` will be fine. 

When the feature is complete and ready to be merged into the master branch, submit a Pull Request on GitHub. Navigate to https://github.com/curtmorgan3/handy_helper
